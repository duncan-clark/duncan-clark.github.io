I am Assistant Professor at Williams College in the Deparment of Statistics.
I received my PhD from the University of California Los Angeles in the Statistics department.
During my PhD I developed Statistical methods focused on social science applications with <a href ="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~handcock/">Professor Mark S. Handcock</a>.
</p>

<p>
In particular I am interested in network generation processes,
Bayesian social network models,
causal inference for social networks and spatial point process models.
Please take a look at my <a href ="https://duncan-clark.github.io/research/">research</a> page for publications and working papers.
In general I am interested in problems where applying an "off the shelf" method does not yield sensible results.
I consider my secret sauce to be the ability to frame a complex problem in a statistically principled manner and drive towards the final outcome of an analysis.

I am originally from the UK and after finishing a masters in Mathematics I trained to be a pensions actuary for two years,
which was great introduction to statistics and data analysis. I've now moved over the pond after finding that I prefered
tackling interesting data driven problems to calculating people's pensions.
I have the privledge to spend my time understanding and explaining data to people and am trying to make career doing just that.

This website gives a couple of examples of small "for fun" projects, as well as a brief description of my current academic research, my CV is available also.

I spend most my free time riding bicycles, sometimes I chase other people riding bicycles in circles too.
Since moving to Williamstown, I have been skiing more, preferabley up hill.
I like baking cakes and bad sourdough, during the Covid19 pandemic I slowly transformed my fridge in into a homemade cheese cave.
Feel free to contact me with any of the below methods, emails relating to cake, skis, bicycles, and/or cheese may receive quicker replies.
