I am a current 4th year PhD student at the University of California Los Angeles in the Statistics department. I am working on social network modelling with <a href ="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~handcock/">Professor Mark Handcock</a>.
In particular I am interested in network generation processes, Bayesian social network models and spatial point process models. In general I am interested in using statistical models to understand complex social processes, and if modeling these more precisely and unambigously can lead to better interpretation of complex social problems. I mostly use R and Python, as well as C++ for speed ups.

I am originally from the UK and after finishing a masters in Mathematics I trained to be a pensions actuary for two years,
which was great grounding in basic statistics and data analysis. I've now moved over the pond after finding that I prefered
tackling interesting data driven problems to calculating pensions. I have the privledge to spend my time understanding and explaining data to people and hope to make a career doing just that.

I spend most my free time baking cakes and bad sourdough as well as riding bicycles, sometimes I chase other people riding bicycles too.
Feel free to contact me with any of the below methods, emails relating to cake and/or bicycles may receive quicker replies.
