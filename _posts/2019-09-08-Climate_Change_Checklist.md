Summary: An objective evidence based list of things to do would be really helpful.

It seems clear to me that current Science points towards humans needing to change the way we live if we want to avoid runaway climate change. I am not an expert or particularly informed in this area, but I do care. I care enough to want to know what I can do, or not do to help combat the problem. 

Being quantitively aligned, this is basically constrained optimisation, minimise the greenhouse gas emissions for each individual given a restriction which is a function of each individual - what they are willing to give up. 

We need an independent international body that publishes a checklist of measures an individual can take, together with their impact. That way an individual can make informed choices, rather than using a black magic mix of online articles and anecdotal conversation with friends, to decide whether or not they should consider not eating red meat or switching the heating off an hour early.

We know what we should do, but the key is that it is just so hard to know what really matters. I know beef produces more greenhouse gases in its production than kale, but does skipping a steak equal getting the bus rather than driving, or does that short flight I took basically wipe out anything I could do. Does cycling instead of driving for short journeys actually matter if I am powered by a fat meaty burrito? And If I really wanted to know where do I go to find the truth?

With information and awareness, people will do what they can, but crucially the effort will not go to waste since it will be informed with objective facts. Simplicity is key and such a checklist needs to be agreed upon and widely accepted and likely needs to be endorsed by governments, to persuade consumers of its credibility.

Yes individuals will not solve the problem, which will likely need structural change to the global economy and perhaps the re-evaluations of GDP as a measure of civilizations success. But as an individual its better to do something than nothing, and to know that what you are doing or not doing has a point.
