I'm not a natural blogger, I don't have deep meaningful thoughts, take great pictures and haven't had to write anything withouth Maths in it since high school. Thus I don't suggest the reader have high hopes for finding fun stories packed with hard hitting insights.

However what I do do is ride my bike a lot. It turns out when I really am thinking of nothing, sometimes I have ideas. Unfortunately I am not impulsive enough to do anything with them and have a terrible memory. So I really intend to use this as a guide to future Duncan, of thoughts that past Duncan had(qudos I think to Hadley Wickham for this analogy). Sit tight for some incoherent dribbling about whatever trip that last 5 hour ride had me on at the time.
