Many problems, and arguably some of the most interesting and least studied are inherently relational, that is observations are inextricably linked to other observations. I am currently working on a novel stochastic social network model, the so called latent order logistic model (LOLOG). We hope to understand the model's properties better, so that it may grow into a useful tool for applied researchers. I am particularly interested in explicit network generating processes, and models that allow for this in their formulation.

I am also interested in the applications of generative models for social networks, in particular their use in the age of very large web based data sets. By their nature generative models are tough to adapt to very large networks, though they give a much stronger insight to networks than simpler models. Key insights on network data surely is an area that can only grow in the future.

Spatial point process models, are in some way analogous to social network models; both seek to allow for the fact that the observations are not independent. Similar problems exist in both fields, namely the intractability of normalizing constants. I wish to explore this relationship, and investigate if methods in both fields may be complimentary.
