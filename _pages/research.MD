Many problems in the social sciences are inherently relational, that is
observations are inextricably linked to other observations. This does
not lend itself to many traditional statistical approaches and generates
many ongoing, difficult and interesting problems. The majority of my
work has been in developing methods for social network analysis, with a
particular interest in applications for approximate causal inference in
a network setting.
