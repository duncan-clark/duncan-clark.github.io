UCLA strava network anaysis [here](https://duncan-clark.github.io./files/UCLA_net_strava.html)

My research is in stochastic social network models, I thought I would try some models out on some everyday social network data in an app that I use everyday - Strava. I thought I would look at different clubs that people on strava affiliate with and see if I could come up with a helpful analysis of the networks.

I managed to scrape the publically available data from strava and did some exploratory analysis on the UCLA cycling team network [here](https://duncan-clark.github.io./files/UCLA_net_strava.html)

Like always there is more to do, I'd like to expand to other networks and see if there are common statistical patterns and correposnding social processes of interest. Any ideas, suggestions and comments welcome - please shoot me an email!
