My research is in stochastic social network models, I thought I would try some models out on some everyday social network data in an app that I use everyday - Strava. I thought I would look at different clubs that people on strava affiliate with and see if I could come up with a helpful analysis of the networks.

This project is in its early stages, my anticipated workflow is as follows:
* Familiarize with Strava API, or learn to web scrape the network data
* Initial data clean and network summary measure analysis
* Fit network models and interpret
* Compare different networks on strava and interpret


Any ideas, suggestions and comments welcome - please shoot me an email!
