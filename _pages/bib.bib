  abstract={Exponential‐family random graph models (ERGMs) are widely used in social network analysis when modelling data on the relations between actors. ERGMs are typically interpreted as a snapshot of a network at a given point in time or in a final state. The recently proposed Latent Order Logistic model (LOLOG) directly allows for a latent network formation process. We assess the real‐world performance of these models when applied to typical networks modelled by researchers. Specifically, we model data from an ensemble of articles in the journal Social Networks with published ERGM fits, and compare the ERGM fit to a comparable LOLOG fit. We demonstrate that the LOLOG models are, in general, in qualitative agreement with the ERGM models, and provide at least as good a model fit. In addition, they are typically faster and easier to fit to data, without the tendency for degeneracy that plagues ERGMs. Our results support the general use of LOLOG models in circumstances where ERGMs are considered.},

    abstract = "{Claiming causal inferences in network settings necessitates careful consideration of the often complex dependency between outcomes for actors. Of particular importance are treatment spillover or outcome interference effects. We consider causal inference when the actors are connected via an underlying network structure. Our key contribution is a model for causality when the underlying network is endogenous; where the ties between actors and the actor covariates are statistically dependent. We develop a joint model for the relational and covariate generating process that avoids restrictive separability and fixed network assumptions, as these rarely hold in realistic social settings. While our framework can be used with general models, we develop the highly expressive class of Exponential-family Random Network models (ERNM) of which Markov random fields and Exponential-family Random Graph models are special cases. We present potential outcome-based inference within a Bayesian framework and propose a modification to the exchange algorithm to allow for sampling from ERNM posteriors. We present results of a simulation study demonstrating the validity of the approach. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the framework in a case study of smoking in the context of adolescent friendship networks.}",
